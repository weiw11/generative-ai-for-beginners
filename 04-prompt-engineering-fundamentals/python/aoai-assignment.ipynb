    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."
